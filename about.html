  <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p> Miguel was born in San Pedro, California, on October 23, 1985. Miguel began writing songs as a teenager and signed his first recording contract in 2004.
    He gained attention for his 2010 release All I Want Is You. His next album, the 2012 record Kaleidoscope Dream, garnered critical acclaim and contained the hit
    single "Adorn," for which Miguel won the 2013 Grammy Award for best R&B song.
    In 2004, Miguel was signed by the independent record label Black Ice. He completed his first studio album, Young & Free, in 2006. Black Ice shelved the album,
    releasing only the single "Getcha Hands Up." Disappointed with the single, its video and his treatment overall, Miguel parted ways with the label. He has since
    stated that this experience taught him to take control of the way in which he was marketed, rather than relying on the label to differentiate him from the crowd
    of male R&B vocalists.
